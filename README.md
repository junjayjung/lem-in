# LEM-IN

## Overview
This project involves creating a digital ant farm simulation called lem-in, which requires implementing algorithms for pathfinding and data manipulation.

## Description
  - The `data.go` file contains functions for reading input data and parsing it into a matrix and dot structure. 
  - The `movement.go` file contains functions for moving the ants through the rooms and managing their paths and occupancy. 
  - The `pathfinder.go` file contains a function to find all possible paths from a start room to an end room using a depth-first search algorithm.

## Usage
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command: `go run . examples/ {File Name (e.g. exapmple01.txt; badexample01.txt)}`
5. Or run the test script by the command `bash test.sh`
